# ⚡ AI-Based Smart Grid Power Theft Detection System

## 📌 Overview

Electricity theft and abnormal power consumption are major challenges in modern power distribution networks. Utilities lose significant revenue every year due to unauthorized electricity usage and inefficient monitoring systems.

This project presents a **MATLAB-based smart grid analytics system** that detects suspicious electricity consumption patterns using machine learning techniques.

The system simulates smart meter data, extracts useful features from electricity load patterns, and applies AI models to identify potential electricity theft.

This project demonstrates how **machine learning and data analytics can enhance monitoring and security in modern smart grids.**

## 🎯 Project Motivation

Traditional electricity meters only measure total energy consumption and provide limited insight into how electricity is being used.

With the development of **smart grids and smart meters**, utilities can collect detailed consumption data from consumers. By analyzing this data intelligently, it becomes possible to detect:

* abnormal electricity usage
* potential energy theft
* unusual consumer behavior

This project explores how **AI models can automatically detect such anomalies**.
